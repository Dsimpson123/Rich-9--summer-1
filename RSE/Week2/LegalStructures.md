My social enterprise would help provide macbooks for kid's in need. In my enterprise I would give kids macbooks who have hopes to proceed their dreams of creating their own business. From the creation of my company, kids would be able to proceed their dreams of being successful.



The structure I would use is nonprofit so i can get investors to invest into my company. If i have a nonprofit organization it will have limited libility's, create structues and build a community. In the end I would create a great organization where kids can go to turn their dreams into reality.
